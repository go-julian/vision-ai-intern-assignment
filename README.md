# Vision AI intern assignment
## Exercise 1 – Image classification

This is the instruction for AI intern assignment at [Golden Owl](https://goldenowl.asia). You will build a simple Image Classification model base on [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) or [Tensorflow](https://tensorflow.org/).

You will do “**Classify dog and cat images**”. For example:

In this exercise, you need to write a program in Python to classify dog and cat images. For dataset that you can collect on internet

You can use teachable machine/your computer for training model

### Requirements
- Your program gets the input as image file and print the output.
- Describe briefly your solution in a report (i.e: your pipeline, algorithms that we use, remaining problem as well as ideas for improvements,...).
- Your solution will be evaluated on our private dataset. So, you need to submit your source and the report.
- Do not forget to write a README.md (i.e: environment requirements, how to run) to guide us to reproduce your code easily.
## Exercise 2 – Text to speech
Text to speech (TTS) is a technology that converts text into spoken audio. It can read aloud PDFs, websites, and books using natural AI voices.. Text-to-speech (TTS) technology can be helpful for anyone who needs to access written content in an auditory format, and it can provide a more inclusive and accessible way of communication for many people.

In this exercise, you are requested to propose your ideas for how to build TTS model (Vietnamese)
### Requirements
-	Proposes your ideas and describes them in a report (i.e: your pipeline, algorithms,...).
-	Try to analyze the problem that we can face and how to solve them.
